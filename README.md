## Contributing

Feel free to add new cheat sheets or improve existing ones. Each cheat sheet should cover:
- Basic syntax and common patterns
- Frequently used operations
- Advanced but commonly needed functionality
- Practical examples

## Organization

Cheat sheets are organized by topic in the `docs/` directory:
- `docs/python/` - Python-related libraries and tools
- Additional directories can be added for other languages/topics as needed

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please see the [README](../README.md) for guidelines on adding new cheat sheets or improving existing ones.

Each cheat sheet should include:
- Basic syntax and common patterns
- Frequently used operations
- Advanced but commonly needed functionality
- Practical examples with clear explanations

## Organization

Cheat sheets are organized by topic:
- `python/` - Python-related libraries and tools
- Additional directories can be added for other languages/topics as needed
